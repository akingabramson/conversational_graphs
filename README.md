# Conversations as Directed Graphs

How useful is it to model conversations as mathematical graphs?

Can we learn about how groups communicate by looking at how frequently they change topics, how many people contribute to a given topic, the content of a topic, and the segues (edges) between topics?

This repo currently contains a graph of the first 30 minutes of a conversation I had with some friends.  It's a side project I find interesting but haven't had much time for.  I haven't dug into the data yet.

I plan to turn the graph into a hashmap (dictionary) with topics as nodes/keys and segues to other topics as edges/values.  If anyone wants to do it for me, I'd be forever thankful.
